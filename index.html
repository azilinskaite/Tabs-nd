        <h2>Gwen Stefani, 90s</h2>
        <p>The tail end of the '90s welcomed No Doubt onto the music scene, and with it, our everlasting love affair with Gwen Stefani's insouciant attitude. As she once put it: “I had to be a little bit tomboy and a little bit glamorous.” The Don't Speak lead singer's signature look comprised midriff-baring crop tops with low-slung boyfriend-fit jeans, with chunky belt chains dangling by her side. Mixing genres like no other, she established the alt-girl angle of the decade. Taking notes from other cyber-goth lovers, Gwen rocked space buns with rich, bold make-up, too. Remember her furry blue, barely-there bikini at the 1998 MTV Video Music Awards? Or her bright pink hair and orthodontic braces for the opening of the Christian Dior boutique in NYC in 1999? It was playful femininity with some serious edge. Then there was her weakness for Vivienne Westwood which saw her sport some of the designer's most covetable pieces. </p>

        <h2>Chloe Sevigny</h2>
        <p>t was 1994 when a profile by Jay McInernery, published in the New Yorker, designated Chloe Sevigny as 'the coolest girl in the world'. She was 19 years old, but people were already desperate to dress like her. She was a thrift store obsessive, hunting through racks to find two-dollar dresses, and a self-confessed fashion magazine junkie. Flicking through Vogue's September issue, in 1994, McInernery captured her running commentary for his story called, rather prophetically, 'Chloe's Scene': 'This Marc Jacobs dress is beautiful...Helmut Lang is my absolute favorite....God, Armani is so old-ladyish...Lagerfeld ruined the house of Chanel; Coco would never have done miniskirts. I watched this documentary about her. She was so great…'</p>

        <h2>Amy Taylor</h2>
        <p>If you've ever been to a concert for Australian 'pub rock' band Amyl and the Sniffers, you'll know it's the closest one could get to the inimitable energy of the '80s and '90s punk scene. ' I like dressing up. I like costumes. I like makeup and wearing my little outfits, fucking around with my hair and all that stuff. I think it reduces [women] to a novelty but at the same time, I can see the merit in novelty because all that shit is fun.'</p>
